# youtube-ctrl-c-downloader
Just another pet project 

```shell
make install-deps
make run
```

Then you can go around in youtube and, anytime you wanna download a video, you can copy its link.
This small script is watching the clipboard and will spawn a thread to download the video you copied using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
