# youtube-ctrl-c-downloader
Pet project I did when I was learning to code back 2017 - 2018.


```shell
make install-deps
make run
```

Then you can go around in youtube and, anytime you wanna download a video, you can copy its link.
This small script is watching the clipboard and will spawn a thread to download it using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
