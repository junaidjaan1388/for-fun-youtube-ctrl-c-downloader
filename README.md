# youtube-ctrl-c-downloader
Pet project I did when I was learning to code back 2017 - 2018.


```shell
make install-deps
make run
```

In 2022, I updated it to make it work again.
b/c originally in 2018, I didn't even know how to install a package and basically copied the
entire `youtube_dl` to use it as a dependency haha
